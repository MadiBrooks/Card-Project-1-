			<p class="description">Distinctly known for the black "tear marks" that marks them from the corner of eye to the bottom of the face, cheetahs are the fastest land mammals on Earth. They are unique from other big cats in that they can't retract their claws, and they have the ability to make chirping sounds. They are currently listed as "Vulnerable" on the Red List of Threatened Species, but there have been many efforts by scientists for the cheetah to be uplisted to "Endangered". This is due mainly to a recent drastic decline in the population caused by habitat loss, poaching, low reproducive success rates.   </p>
